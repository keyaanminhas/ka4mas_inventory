As someone who prefers comfortability when it comes to downloading CC my go-to website is simsdom.com. There are definitely other websites to go to in search of CC though. The famous one as many may know is the TSR (The Sims Resource). TSR is a great source and can even help you learn how to make your own custom content. Simdom is a landing page of sorts that’ll often redirect to Patreon pages of animators or take you to simshare (a 1000 percent trusted site for downloading mods and custom content into your game).
Hi @TheSIM_4playrPerhaps try just a few at a time, (it could be just 1 breaking your game) and not too many? Also, the Sims 4 Studio has what it calls 'batch fixes' for all the packs.. (and a forum to help you work with it, if needed) therefore fine-tunes different problems with cc, I have a lot of cc and use this and other tools. If you are new to using cc/mods please check my post here on maintaining your game. Sashanb: Sims Fan & I have no connection to EA
Updated on June 30th, 2021 by Anastasia Maillot: Even if The Sims 4 as a game remains flawed and lacking in some regard, its modding community never rests when it comes to making it a better game. That not only includes gameplay-enhancing mods, but also custom content artists that bring to life clothing, accessories, and objects players have always dreamed of having in their game.

## Accessories for the sims 4.

Accessories are the things that show off our characters. Whether it’s a hat, some earrings or a wristband – we love it when we can tell the world who we are through a nonstandard piece of clothing. And accessory being the finishing touch of every look, we thought it deserved a detailed looking into. Here are the community’s favorite accessory mods for The Sims 4!
Watches are not a common thing in The Sims 4 either, but this mod brings a lot of value to the table. We love the modern high-class, yet relaxing design and the way the golden shade is done especially. We use it regularly, and you’ll need to download the mod from this site to do so as well.
MXIMS's objects are extremely high in detail and clearly inspired by real-world styles. On their Tumblr page, you can find Apple electronics and minimalistic Scandinavian style furniture that's only been recently officially included in actual expansions and packs in The Sims 4.

And the nose must not be excluded from these glorious mods by Pralinesims. Whether it’s a gentle stud or a heavy ring, you’ll find it all here!
