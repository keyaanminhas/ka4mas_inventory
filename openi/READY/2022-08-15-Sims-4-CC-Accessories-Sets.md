The lip piercings are also not in shortage – in fact they’re in abundance in this popular pack which we found at The Sims Resource. 18 fantastic styles for the left side, the right and the middle that we can combine to no end – what more can we ask for? Hurry up and get the set from here.
All the pieces have a bunch of different beautiful swatches (btw I've added some more swatches so I advise my testers to redownload if they want em). They also have normal and specular maps. The Skull earrings have two versions with two different fits for the ear. There are also two version of the Enchained top; one using the bg nude top, one using @luumia 's BOD-E II lean. The accs lace top can be found in right wrist. Fantom mask is found in hats.
It’s quite clear that you can never have enough piercings in your collection. You always want to change them up a bit; to put a circle instead of an arrow, to replace the one on the nose for one on the brow and that is exactly what this mod offers – an entire set for brow piercings only! Enjoy it fully after you download it from here!

## Bad sims 4 cc accessories sets

I have reworked all the textures, added 5 swatches across the whole collection and made these new versions as entirely new packages so the original files are not required. There are 10 items in total. They are pretty high poly but still under 10k each. I hope you enjoy!
A few words on the butterflies:
nose ring version is mapped on the hat texture space; it is compatible with every hat in this set but will conflict with other hats - if you want to use nose rings you can leisurely change category to anything else
necklace version is mapped on the necklace texture space (duh) and it can be used with all hats but you won’t be able to use *real* necklaces
