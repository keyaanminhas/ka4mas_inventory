
## Start a side hustle.

Put any up-front costs you’ll need in your budget. This is super important. Remember, you aren’t going to go into debt to make extra money. That’s like digging a hole when your goal is to fill in a hole. If you realize you can’t afford the up-front costs of this side hustle, find a different option! There are plenty that don’t cost a dime to jump into.
Create an online course with a platform like Udemy or Teachable and leverage some of your skills to create a healthy extra income. Depending upon how much time you invest in your course, you could make a substantial side revenue stream by creating courses that deliver tremendous amounts of value.
Do you have some spare cash lying about? If so, why not consider peer-to-peer lending? In essence, you’ll lend people money and receive a higher return. Make sure you always check that lenders can pay you back, otherwise you risk losing a lot of money — a good idea is to assess their lending history and only offer small loans at the beginning to make sure they can be trusted with larger sums.

## Offer services in your community.

This could also break off into nutrition and assisting people with meal plans, and so on. You could solicit clients in your local gym, but depending on where you live, you might need some certification to do this (not to mention the gym's approval). You could also use a site like FitnessTrainer to advertise your services.
You can do this through a local branch of a national organization like United Way, work for a local service organization or start your own. Community service managers develop community programs such as after-school care, hire and lead staff, raise funds and manage budgets, and carry out plans to provide community services and support.
Again, a site like Care.com also helps to connect home organizers with people looking for this type of service. It all depends on whether you want to go through a professional company or pitch it yourself to people that are already in your personal or business network. You could advertise your availability for home jobs through a Facebook group specific to your area.

## Sell products online.

Try to sell your products on multiple platforms and marketplaces instead of just one. The more places your products live, the more likely people will be to find them. There are hundreds of online selling sites, all with their own niches and commission fees. A few examples include:
You could make money online by selling on several different platforms. If you’re looking to drive sales offline, you can use Facebook buy and sell groups in your community to find people online and sell the items in person. I’ve personally sold through these groups before and know they work.
