First we run the run1 file to get the titles from the roblox website

Now we wait....

file was there from previous test...

DONE
I am going to use 2 titles as I dont have much credit

run2 is to generate the text from the AI website

Now we wait.... this might take a while......

here we will see our file

First title is complete now we wait for the second one.. you can skip the video i guess

each title takes about 1 minute....

THATS our titles....



now the third step is to add the code snippets and little bit formatting which will make it ready to upload


run3 does that

and we have our md files


To upload we use run4


we wait like 5-10 seconds....
one down
two down.... done
and now we can check github

bye
